# TCRUDS - Text Create Read Update Delete Style
Created By Ezra - Full-Stack Developer.

This is the app which serves as a backbone of many applications, which I dreamed for finally created with the help of Next.js App Router.

In this app I took the plain text as the data to understand the entire full-stack application.

## Why TCRUDS?

- Text
- Create
- Read
    - Search
    - List
    - Pagination
- Update
- Delete
- Style

We can use this app as a boilerplate of many applications.
